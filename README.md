To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `./scripts/reset.sh`
  * Run you tests with `mix test`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
